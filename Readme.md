# Shapes_Detection_with_Python
Project of shapes detection with Python.

The project was firstly thought to be a road signs detection using computer vision with Python and its library OpenCV. 
Due to the difficulty of that, finally it consisted ofÂ shapes detection, making difference between rectangles, triangles, octogons and circles.

Done with Python (mainly using the library OpenCV).

The main code is in the repository, as well as the final memory where there is a full explanation of the code and some examples of how it works.
